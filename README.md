# pokemon-battle
This is an upgraded version of my first CS project - [pokemon-simulation](https://github.com/kanaluM/pokemon-simulation) - originally in Python, now in Golang. 

This is a text-based terminal game where you can partake in a Pokemon battle against Champion Cynthia

If you already have Go installed, you can simply run `go run .` to start the simulation. A Dockerfile is also provided and should theoretically work if you do not have Go installed locally.
